# OSCAL Foundation Test Bed Project

Welcome to the home of the OSCAL Foundation Test Bed Project. Here, the Technical Working Group (TWG) is collaboratively creating a set of example OSCAL documents to enable testing and education activities.

# Current document groups

basic - This set of documents is meant to represent a minimum set of OSCAL Documents to provide very basic examples of how OSCAL functions.

advanced - This set of documents is meant to cover the entire OSCAL schema in order to test edge cases or explore specific use cases.

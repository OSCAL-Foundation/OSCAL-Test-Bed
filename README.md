# OSCAL Foundation Test Bed Project

Welcome to the home of the OSCAL Foundation Test Bed Project. Here, the Technical Working Group (TWG) is collaboratively creating a set of example OSCAL documents to enable testing and education activities.

# Current list of documents

basic-catalog.json - A simple catalog with four basic controls, each with a straightforward parameter.

basic-profile-low - A simple profile that selects two of the controls from the above catalog and sets their parameters.

basic-profile-high - A simple profile that selects all four of the controls from the above catalog and sets their parameters to more strict values.
